## Do Now 2.7 Bouncing Ball

1. Open a new Snap project and change the sprite's costume to a ball.

2. Using the following blocks, write a script that continuously moves the ball across the screen and bounces the ball when it hits the edge of the screen.

  - ![if on edge, bounce](ifedgebounce.png)
  - ![when Green Flag clicked ](whenclicked.PNG)
  - ![move 3 steps](move3.PNG)
  - ![forever](forever.png)

3. Add a second sprite.  Add the same script from step 2 above for the new sprite.

4. What happens when you run?  Explain what you observe.
